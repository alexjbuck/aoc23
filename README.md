Welcome to my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023! :star:

## About Advent of Code :gift:

Advent of Code is an annual online competition created by Eric Wastl. It consists of a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels in any programming language you like. :computer:

## My Approach :rocket:

I'll be using Advent of Code 2023 to practice my Rust ðŸ¦€ skills, aiming to learn new concepts and improve my problem-solving skills. :muscle:

Each solution is contained in its own directory, named by the day of the Advent. To run a solution, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in the README. :file_folder:
